Well, hello there. My name is [Kenton Hansen](http://startupwichita.com/profile/kenton-hansen). You might remember me from such works as _"Startup Weekend Wichita"_ or _"The Labor Party."_ Today, however, I'm here to talk about this web application started at a Hackathon in March 2014 with [devICT](http://devict.org).

The projects beta was completed and launched about three months later at [startupwichita.com](http://startupwichita.com), and we as a community have been contributing to its development since then.
